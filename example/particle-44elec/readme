$plasmon namelist:
nst is the number of states of the nanoparticle
mscoup is coupling between the metallic nanoparticle and semiconductor, which is taken as a parameter
eps_coup is electron-plasmon coupling in the metallic nanoparticle

barirer_e, barrier_h are barrier height for electron/hole, which are taken as half of "onesite" in system namelist

$system namelist:
the onsite is the energy gap of the two-level system of semiconductor (I model the semiconductor as a two-level system, hence, ns=2 
is used in this namelist)
elecoup is the line-with of self-energy due to coupling to electrodes, 

$voltage namelist
ampl ampr: left, right bias; ampg is not used.

$photon namelist
phfreq photon frequency
